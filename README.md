Introduction
------------

Collage is a low-precision training strategy for large language models (LLMs). 
Collage makes use of multi-component floats to reduce the memory footprint during training, particularly for optimization, 
with purely low-precision (e.g. BFloat16) arithmetic without consorting to Float32. 

It is simple to use Collage by replacing `AdamW` with our `AdamW_collage` optimizer and use different `collage` options, i.e., `light` or `plus` 
(check our paper for more details). We provide Collage training for BERT & RoBERTa and also multi-size GPTs with the NeMo Megatron framework. 

Requirements
------------
1) python 3.8 or above
2) transformers 4.31.0 or above
3) pytorch 1.13.1 + CUDA 11.7 or above

We recommend using NeMo ``r1.22.0`` with released container ``nemo:23.11``

    docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:23.11.framework
